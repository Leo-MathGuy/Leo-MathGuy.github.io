                Rick Astely, singing <i>Never Gonna Give You Up</i> and himself today. Notice how he
                changed a lot, and how you were rickrolled yourself by seeing this page. Isn't this so ironical?
                Lol. Almost as if this is filler text. So there was Ipsum, and there was Lorem, and then there were
                2 cats unrelated to Lorem and Ipsum. But the cats, Lorem and Ipsum are completely filler text. Why
                are you even reading this. Go get a life. Touch grass. Actually shouldn't I be following this
                advice? But no. I am a complete nerd who takes the hardest classes, watches undertale lore while
                making his portfolio for no reason. And when I decide to finally go to sleep, I either trip and fall
                in my sleep or get an existential crisis for a minute, quiestioning everything that exists and why
                does everything exist and how does it exist and what is the universe itself. I just realized I spent
                4 minutes writing filler text while already having an existential crisis.
